This is a course project during 2016Fall semester at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

I, with another two team members, established an E-commerce web application with features of Register, Log in, 
Place order, Manage Cart, Checkout, and also an administration console for staff members to keep track of orders.

We implemented the website by MVC model and I was in charge of servlets to handle different kinds of requests.

We finished this project following the tutorial at https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/javaee/ecommerce/design.html
